### Atmospheric & Climate Science Ph.D. Programs

The student follows a program of study and research approved by his/her doctoral advisory committee. Course requirements include a minimum of 60 hours of graduate credit in organized courses, seminars, and independent study in atmospheric, climate, environmental, and other sciences or mathematics. Students must complete the Atmospheric Science or Climate Science coursework requirements for the M.S. degree, respectively. These requirements can be satisfied by coursework while earning an M.S. degree. This program includes, in addition, research leading to an acceptable dissertation.

#### Departmental Examinations

1. Written Qualifying Examination: The student must pass a written exam that covers the student’s particular program area: synoptic–dynamic meteorology, physical meteorology and atmospheric physics, atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics, paleoclimatology, or environmental science.
2. Oral Qualifying Examination: The student must pass an oral examination that is administered by the student’s doctoral committee. The exam is based on a written and oral prospectus prepared by the student that describes the basis and approach for the dissertation research.
3. Dissertation Defense: The student must satisfactorily complete an oral presentation and defense of the dissertation.

#### Ancillary Duties

In addition to the completion of course requirements, satisfactory performance in some ancillary teaching, research, or practicum duties contributing to academic development is required. These duties will be assigned with educational objectives in mind.

#### Dissertation

The student must submit a dissertation in their area of specialization, which represents a significant and original contribution in the field of atmospheric or environmental sciences.

#### Full Time Study in Residence

Each student in a doctoral program must engage in full-time study beyond the Master’s degree, or equivalent at the University, for at least two semesters after admission to the advanced program. This requirement is designed to ensure a sustained period of intensive intellectual growth. For this purpose, a student will enroll in full-time study (nine credits) taken in each of two semesters, or in a regular semester and a summer session, not necessarily consecutive, which must be completed satisfactorily.

Graduate assistants holding a full assistantship may meet the full-time residency requirement by completing one academic year in such a position, including the satisfactory completion of a minimum of nine credits per semester plus satisfactory completion of assigned duties.

#### Admission to Candidacy

A student is admitted to candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy upon the following: 
1. Satisfactory record in course and seminar study (i.e., 60 credit hours)
2. Completion of University residence requirements
3. Satisfactory completion of the research tool requirement
4. Satisfactory completion of the qualifying examinations

## Department Guidelines

### General Information

Students who consider the Master’s degree as an option for an intermediate or terminal degree, should initially follow the guidelines for the respective Master’s Program in order to satisfy the requirements for that degree. (Note: Doctoral students should not take ATM 699 unless they are certain they plan to obtain the M.S. degree since credits for ATM 699 are recorded as “Incomplete” until a Master’s thesis is submitted and approved.)

Doctoral students must register for nine credits every semester if they are supported as a GA, TA, or RA, in order to maintain full-time student status. Students intending to achieve PhD candidacy (i.e., 60 credits) at the end of three years will need to take, with their research advisor’s consent, 12 credits per semester in their third year in order to have accumulated the 60 credits required for candidacy (Note: This option may not be available to TAs and GAs due to state funding.). During the last semester before advancing to candidacy, a student may enroll in less than nine credits if they need less than nine to earn 60 credits (e.g., a student has 54 credits and only needs six to reach 60). If a student wishes to take less than nine credits, they must submit a [Reduced Credit Load form](https://www.albany.edu/graduate/resources-current-students) and send the confirmation email to The Graduate Program Director. Doctoral students achieving candidacy need register for only one credit of ATM 899. If a student wishes to take a class after candidacy, they must still enroll in ATM 899. Unless a leave of absence is requested and granted, all other students must register for at least three credits to satisfy the requirement of continuous registration. 

A PhD student who seeks award of the M.S. “along the way” must obtain supplementary M.S. program activation via submittal of a form and fee (see also page 15). If a student wishes to terminate with the M.S. degree, the student should, AFTER activation of the M.S. program, email their intention to withdraw from the Ph.D. program to The Graduate School. A student who has converted to the M.S. program and is not an international student does not need to register if they have completed all M.S. requirements except for submittal of the thesis (Note: Non-registered students do not have access to student services). International students are required to be registered in order to maintain student visa status.

### Benchmarks for Progress

0–36 credits
: Register for credits to satisfy Master’s degree requirements and/or courses to prepare for doctoral written exam as advised, along with doctoral research (ATM 898).

36–54 credits: Doctoral Written Qualifying Exam
: Approximate time frame: Near, or shortly after, completion of Master’s thesis or end of second year/beginning of third year (if intending to skip Master’s degree) or end of first year/beginning of second year of studies in program for students with Master’s and graduate credit from another institution.

60 credits: Doctoral Oral Qualifying Exam (Prospectus)
: Approximate time frame: About one year after passing written exam. Upon passing oral exam, earning 60 credits, satisfying the University Research Tool, and full-time study-in-residency requirements, the department nominates the student for candidacy. Student must achieve candidacy at least one semester prior to graduation.

≥60 credits: Doctoral candidacy. 
: Register for one credit of ATM 899 each semester; complete research; write dissertation; apply for graduation; present thesis seminar/oral defense.

The degree must be completed within eleven calendar years from the date of initial registration in the program unless an extension is requested and granted by The Graduate School.

### Doctoral Written Qualifying Exam

The purpose of the Doctoral Written Exam is to evaluate a student’s critical analysis skills and their ability to apply the scientific method to answer important questions in the field. The written examination focuses on the student’s broad area of specialty, such as physical meteorology, synoptic–dynamic meteorology, tropical meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics, paleoclimatology, or environmental sciences. Each examination is constructed so as to accommodate the background and focus of individual students. Relevant questions can involve analyzing figures, equations, or results; designing an experiment to answer a scientific question; and/or critical evaluation of papers in the scientific literature.

Students who enter with a Master’s degree must take the written exam by the end of the third semester of enrollment, while students who enter without a Master’s degree must take the exam by the end of the spring semester of their third year. Students are allowed two attempts to pass the written qualifying examination. A third attempt may be allowed in unusual circumstances and then only after approval by the Graduate Program Committee upon formal petition by the student, with support of the student’s advisor(s).

The date of the written examination is determined by the student and their committee. The student should email the Graduate Program Director stating their intention to take the exam and the names of their committee members. This step will assist in coordinating the exam with other students, particularly if multiple students have the same examining committee members.

The examining committee should consist of four faculty members, include the student’s research advisor(s), and at least one member whose primary affiliation is with the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. Only those with an earned doctorate or those who hold a full professorship are eligible to participate formally in dissertation advisement and the approval of a dissertation. Exceptions to the committee membership requirements can be made with the approval of the Graduate Program Committee. A student’s examining committee may consist of the same people as the student’s Ph.D. thesis committee; however, this is not a requirement.

The examining committee creates questions that are designed to test the student’s ability to understand, synthesize, and critically evaluate material in their subfield, including topics covered in advanced graduate courses, as well as in the refereed literature. An examiner may give the same question to multiple students taking the exam at the same time. Students are required to meet with each committee member prior to the exam to discuss possible question topics or literature to review. The student must keep a record of these meetings and communicate the dates to their thesis advisor(s). The committee is required to review the exam prior to administration to evaluate the breadth, depth, and appropriateness of the questions. Following the exam, the committee shall meet to determine the outcome of the exam. The student’s advisor(s) is(are) responsible for sending a memo with the outcome of the student’s exam, the names of the committee members, and scores to the Graduate Program Director. An electronic copy of exam questions and the student’s graded answers shall be emailed to the Graduate Program Director to be placed in the student’s file.

#### Structure of Doctoral Written Qualifying Examination
1. 	Two questions are obtained from each member of the exam committee. The written exam consists of eight total questions, with four questions given to the student on each of the two days of the exam. The student must choose, and submit answers to, three out of four questions each day; only answers to these three questions will be evaluated and graded. To ensure that the student answers at least one question from each committee member, the first day should consist of both questions from two committee members, while the second day should consist of both questions from the other two members. The exam must contain a cover sheet, a sample of which can be obtained at http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/kristen/GraduateProgram/.

2. The committee chair(s) should reserve an ETEC conference room for the exam. The student may bring snacks, paper, pens/pencils, a pocket (i.e., non-cell phone) calculator, and a specially designated laptop (see #4 below) into the exam room, but not their cell phone (the student may designate a contact person in case of a personal emergency).  
 
3. 	The student should be given six hours per day to answer the questions, with a break for lunch. The committee may grant extra time if necessary.

4. The student may write the answers to their exam on paper or on a laptop computer (with internet access disabled) acquired from Kevin Tyle. The student must request the laptop from Kevin at least one month prior to the exam.

5. The student may bring one, 8.5” x 11” sheet of handwritten notes (both sides; no copied text, inserted graphics, cut and paste figures, etc.) into the exam. The sheet must be turned in with the student’s answers. In addition, the examination committee may give the student hard copies of materials (e.g., journal articles, textbooks, data, research results, etc.) that may be used in answering the questions; these materials may be communicated to the student before the exam at the required meeting. 

6. Exam questions are graded on a scale of 0 to 10 with an average score of seven or more considered to be passing. The examining committee must vote on whether the student passed the exam. The student passes the exam if the average score on the exam is seven or greater. For an average score in the gray area (around 6.5 to seven), the examining committee decides whether to fail, pass, or conditionally pass (for instance, require additional course work to make up for a deficiency). The definitions of scores are:
 
| Score | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 10    |  Question is answered completely and thoroughly. |
| 8.5   |  Answer contains appropriate analysis and information, with minor issues in either fact or logic. |
| 7.0   |  Answer is characterized by some flaws in either logic or analysis, but meets minimum standards of PhD quality work. |
| 5.0   |  Answer contains either a major logical flaw, error in the analysis of the results, or lacks sufficient depth as would be expected for a PhD student. |
| 3.0   |  Answer contains multiple major logical flaws, errors in analysis, and lacks sufficient depth.|


### Doctoral Oral Qualifying Exam/Prospectus and Candidacy

Upon successful completion of the Written Examination, the student, with the advice of their thesis advisor(s), has the responsibility to organize a Ph.D. thesis committee. The student must submit the composition of the committee to the Graduate Program Committee Director. The committee must consist of at least four faculty members, one of which must have their primary affiliation in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. The student’s thesis advisor will serve as chair (co-advisors serve as co-chairs) of the committee. Only those with an earned doctorate are eligible to participate formally in dissertation advisement and the approval of a dissertation. This committee will have the responsibility for guiding the student in all aspects of their dissertation research. The student is strongly encouraged, and expected, to confer with all committee members, individually or as a group, on a regular basis. At the discretion of the committee, the student may be required periodically to provide a written and/or oral progress report. 

The student must submit a formal written thesis prospectus to their Ph.D. thesis advisory committee. The prospectus will serve as the basis for the oral qualifying examination and must consist of: (1) a clear statement of the research objectives and their scientific importance; (2) a critical review of the background scientific literature; and, (3) a carefully described proposed research plan including the method of attack to solve the problem. The prospectus is not intended to be a preliminary dissertation of the student’s research. Description of the student’s research should be included only in so far as it provides background for the proposed research plan. The prospectus should not need to exceed 25 pages of text (figures and references are not included in the limit). A student is expected to consult closely with their advisor while developing the prospectus.

The Ph.D. thesis advisory committee must have at least one week to read the formal prospectus before the scheduled oral examination. The oral examination consists of an open departmental seminar with questions allowed from the audience followed by a closed session with the committee for additional questioning. The public presentation should not exceed 45 minutes. During the student’s presentation, questions from the audience should be limited to clarifications only. Following the end of the presentation, the members of the audience who are not on the Ph.D. committee are free to ask questions related to the presentation. Once all of the general audience questions are answered, the audience will be excused and the student will answer questions from the Ph.D. committee related to the topic and prospectus.

A student who conditionally passes the oral qualifying exam may be asked to correct demonstrated deficiencies through additional course work and/or by submitting a revised prospectus for approval by their thesis committee. A student who does not pass the oral examination after two tries may be allowed a third attempt in unusual circumstances and then only after approval by the Graduate Program Committee upon formal petition by the student. 

The department, upon the student’s completion of the residency and Research Skill (foreign language/computer programming) requirements, and the Written and Oral Ph.D. exams, nominates the student for Ph.D. candidacy. Candidacy should be attained at least one semester prior to the semester in which application for graduation is made. 

### Doctoral Research and Thesis Defense

Students should proceed with their doctoral dissertation research in close collaboration with their advisor(s). The other committee members will be available to the student for consultation. The research program may be carried out away from the University at Albany with the approval and supervision of the student’s Ph.D. thesis advisory committee. Such students must also satisfy the University Residency requirements. 

The dissertation should demonstrate the candidate’s mastery of a research problem, and their ability to arrive at results and conclusions that contribute significantly to knowledge of the subject area. In general, it is expected that the dissertation will be of the quality comparable to that found in articles in high-quality, well-regarded, refereed scientific journals. When the student and advisor(s) agree that the doctoral dissertation is in final form, copies should be submitted to the rest of the student’s committee and a date for the formal Ph.D. thesis defense scheduled. Committee members must be allowed at least two weeks to read the dissertation. The student will defend their dissertation by giving a 45-minute seminar to the full department followed by questions and comments from the committee. The thesis committee, including the student’s advisor(s), must formally vote to approve the dissertation. If two or more members of the committee do not approve, the dissertation must be revised and resubmitted for approval at a later date.


### Research Tool Requirement

A doctoral student can satisfy the requirement in any one of the following ways:

- By earning a grade of B or better in a graduate foreign language course 
- By passing the University’s Foreign Language Translation Exam. Students will be given approximately two pages of text in the foreign language of their choice to translate into English. Currently, the exam is offered in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish
- By earning a grade of B or better in CSI 501.
- By obtaining formal certification of competency in a scientific computer language from a designee of the Atmospheric Science Department (Kevin Tyle). The student may propose or be assigned a task that demonstrates competency, but the Oral Exam Presentation is generally enough to demonstrate the student’s computing abilities. (MOST COMMON)
- By demonstrating competence in a laboratory or field-based research technique or skill certified by the student’s doctoral committee or a person designated by that committee for this purpose.

## Department Policies

### Teaching Assistant Policies

University rules dictate that a student may serve as a teaching assistant (TA) for up to four years if entering the university without a Master’s degree; otherwise, the limit is three years. A student who enters the university with TA support will automatically receive TA support for a second academic year, as long as the student remains in good academic standing and has performed their TA duties in a satisfactory manner. In order to receive TA support beyond two years, the student’s academic advisor(s) must petition the Graduate Program Committee in writing prior to the preferred application deadline (currently 5 January). The Graduate Program Committee’s decision to grant an additional year of TA support will be based on the student’s progress toward degree in relation to the program timeline, the availability of other funding, and performance of TA duties. Current students who wish to be shifted onto TA support during the next academic year are subject to the same requirements as a student requesting TA support beyond two years. If new and continuing TA requests exceed the CAS-allotted number of positions, preference will be given to students advised by DAES faculty.

Prior to the beginning of each semester, the Graduate Program Committee shall assign teaching assistants to specific courses. Priority will be given to courses based on enrollment, course workload, and special needs of the instructor. Teaching faculty will be polled about the expected duties for a TA and the expected number of hours of work per week. Typical TA duties include attending lecture, holding office hours, grading, assisting students with in-class activities, development of class materials, holding review sessions, and managing BrightSpace, but duties will vary based on the needs of the class. Faculty requests for particular skills and teaching assistants will be taken under advisement.

TAs are assigned to individual courses based on the following priority guidelines:

#### 100–200 level courses: 
Up to one TA per 100 students

#### 300–400 level and required graduate (e.g., ATM 500, 504, 551) courses:
- Courses that include a lab session
- Medical limitations of the instructor
- Courses with significant one-on-one instruction time, or courses where the TA provides substantial day-to-day instructional support beyond the typical TA duties (i.e., office hours, grading, attending class)
- Course enrollment

### Research Assistant Policies

Research assistants (RAs) are employees of the Research Foundation (RF) and are paid to assist their advisor(s) with research related to a grant. DAES and ASRC use the following general job description for all RAs, but specific duties will vary based on the requirements of the grant and type of research conducted: This position provides research support to the DAES/ASRC student working under the supervision of the Principal Investigator (PI). Students will carry out tasks in conformance with the requirements of the research project grant they are funded by and as directed by the PI. Activities will vary and may be carried out in the laboratory, workstation, library, or the field as described in the grant proposal description. Incumbents exercise initiative, creativity, judgment, collaboration, and discretion in performance of these activities.

Continuation of RA funding from year to year is dependent on the satisfactory performance of grant-related research duties by the student and availability of funds. Advisors and students are strongly encouraged to discuss research expectations and funding each semester, and are required to do so at least once per year as per the Mentorship Guidelines (pages 20–23). If an advisor wishes to stop funding a student due to poor performance, they must meet with the Graduate Program Director, DAES or ASRC research administrator, and, potentially, an RF Human Resources representative to discuss the poor performance and design a 60-day, performance improvement plan. The details of the plan will depend on the specific goals of the grant, but need to include a clear explanation of how the student’s performance has been unsatisfactory, specific tasks the student needs to achieve over the 60-day period to maintain funding, a meeting schedule for the 60-day period, and an explanation of what will happen (i.e., removal of funding and tuition support) if the tasks are not fulfilled. The 60-day period must conclude before the fall or spring semester drop deadline for classes.

### Residency
U.S. citizens and permanent residents are required promptly establish New York State residency upon arrival, <https://www.albany.edu/cost-aid/residency-requirements>, including getting a New York driver’s license, registering to vote, getting a bank account using their New York address, and placing a utility service (e.g., electricity, internet, etc.) in their name as soon as they arrive in Albany (i.e., before the start of the semester). Becoming a resident is important as, after the first year of study, any tuition scholarship will cover only the in-state New York resident rate. For a typical student, who started the program during the fall semester, the deadline for submitting paperwork is 1 October of the student’s second academic year, but students are strongly encouraged to submit their application and supporting documents in May or June. Students should retain copies of their official UAlbany and DAES/ASRC offer letters as supporting documents.


### Stipends

There are three stipend levels depending on progress toward degree. The first level is for students who enter the program without an M.S. degree; the second level is for students who enter the program with an M.S., and those who earn an M.S. at UAlbany or pass the written exam, whichever comes first; finally, the third level is for students who have passed the Ph.D. prospectus and advanced to candidacy. The stipend amounts for 2025–2026 are $33,462, $35,135, and $36,808.

During the academic year, student stipends, whether as a GA, TA, or RA, are paid at a rate of 20 hours per week, as mandated by Human Resources. This stipend is paid for work related to: 1) TA duties (if state funded as a TA); 2) research conducted in support of the grant funding them (if an RA); or, 3) the duties outlined by their supervisor (if a state-funded GA). In addition to their paid TA, RA, or GA duties, students enrolled in classes and/or research credits (e.g., ATM 698, 699, 898, 899) are expected to engage in ~3 hours of schoolwork for each credit to further their education and/or conduct their thesis research (which may or may not align with their grant funding). The 20 hours per week academic year stipend is a standard set by Human Resources that indicates student status, and may contribute to, but is not in lieu of, the academic obligation (i.e., 3 hours per credit) that is required of graduate students to make progress towards their degree. Students who have advanced to doctoral candidacy only register for one credit but are expected to maintain a similar level of effort toward completion of their degree. During the summer, graduate students are employees of the RF and are paid for 30 hours per week. Students should discuss these guidelines and expectations with their research advisor(s).

If a student wishes to pursue employment outside the University, they should discuss the matter with their advisor(s), to ensure secondary employment does not hinder degree progress.


### Thesis Defense/Prospectus Times and Format

During the Fall 2025 semester, thesis defenses and prospectuses will take place in person and via Zoom on Fridays after 11:30 AM. **Students must arrange their seminar time with the Graduate Program Director as early as possible on a first-come first-served basis.** Available dates may be found on the [department calendar](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/daesgsc/). If a student wishes to present during Climate Group Meeting (11:30 AM–12:30 PM), they must seek approval from the group’s faculty advisor, Prof. Aiguo Dai. The DAES Graduate Program Director may grant an exception based on need for an alternative day. Outside of the academic year, thesis defense and prospectus may be scheduled anytime during regular business hours.


Students must send their presentation abstract and a Zoom link to the Graduate Program Director at least one week before their scheduled presentation so that a timely announcement can be sent out. Students should also email the RGSO Webmaster, Kaiden Sookdar (ksookdar@albany.edu), to have their presentation added to the calendar once their date is approved by Graduate Program Director.


### Thesis Due Dates

In order to graduate in a particular academic term, the written thesis must be turned in to The Graduate School by the following dates:
- Fall: 1 December
- Winter: Friday before start of the spring semester
- Spring: 1 May
- Summer: 1 August


A maximum 10-day extension may be granted by The Graduate School via email petition by the thesis chair(s) to The Graduate School at etd@albany.edu. 


### Obtaining an M.S. Degree


A student who is admitted into the Ph.D. program may obtain an M.S. degree “along the way” by completing the degree requirements outlined on pages 2–6, filling out the [Supplemental Program Application](https://www.albany.edu/graduate/graduate-programs/supplemental-degree-programs) form, and paying the $20 fee.


### Research Credit Descriptions

ATM 698 (1–9 credits)
: M.S. research. This course can be taken by a student in the M.S. or Ph.D. program at any time and can be repeated multiple semesters. The appropriate grade is “S”.

ATM 699 (1–6 credits)
: Master’s thesis research credits. Any student who wishes to complete a Master’s thesis must complete at least six credits of this course. Should only be used if a student is going to submit a thesis to the Office of Graduate Studies. There is no limit on the total number of credits of this course. The appropriate grade is “I” for incomplete, which will change to “S” once the thesis is submitted and approved. 

ATM 898 (1–9 credits)
: Ph.D. research. This course can be taken by a student in the PhD program at any time and can be repeated multiple semesters. The appropriate grade is “R”.

ATM 899 (One credit)
: One credit class for students who have obtained candidate status (Prospectus approved, 60 credits earned). The appropriate grade is “L”.


### Transfer Credit Requests


Ph.D. students who have taken courses as a graduate student at another institution may transfer up to 30 credits. The Graduate Program Director will work with students to identify appropriate transfer credits and to file the necessary paperwork with The Graduate School. Up to six graduate credits from another institution may be applied to the 30 credits required for the Master’s degree. 

### International Travel
Students who are planning to travel internationally, for person or professional reasons, and will access University servers or accounts while they are overseas with their personal or advisor-supplied computer must register with, and have their travel approved by, the University and/or Research Foundation. Information about this registration and approval can be found at [here](https://livealbany.sharepoint.com/sites/web_research/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fweb%5Fresearch%2FShared%20Documents%2FORRC%2FAnnouncements%20%26%20Hot%20Topics%2FExport%20Controls%20and%20International%20Travel%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fweb%5Fresearch%2FShared%20Documents%2FORRC%2FAnnouncements%20%26%20Hot%20Topics&p=true&ga=1) and [here](https://www.albany.edu/risk-management-compliance/policy/faculty-and-staff-international-travel).

### Mentorship

Seeking out and cultivating productive, supportive advising and mentoring relationships is vitally important to the academic and professional success of graduate students. These relationships also enrich the culture of collaboration and scholarly enterprise within DAES, ASRC, UAlbany, and the greater atmospheric science community. Good mentoring and advising relationships require active participation and engagement from both the student and advisor/mentor. To achieve the goals of productive and equitable advising and mentoring across DAES and ASRC, mentorship guidelines are included starting on page 20 to provide a starting point for important conversations and a framework for advising to help both students and advisors achieve success.

### Graduate Student Activity Reports

All students are required to submit a yearly graduate student activity form at the end of the spring semester. The form (link sent by The Graduate Program Director each year) covers the concluding academic year and includes: 1) publications; 2) presentations (both oral and poster); 3) awards; 4) outreach, service, and engagement activities within/to the department/university, professional societies, the greater community, etc.; 5) a short description of progress toward degree; and, 6) a plan for progress towards degree and professional development during the next academic year. This last section should be written in consultation with the student’s advisor(s) after meeting to evaluate progress and establish goals for the upcoming year. Students who fail to submit these reports are subject to sanctions by the Program Committee.

### Office Space

Students who are registered for classes and/or being paid as a GA, TA,or RA will be provided desk space. Desk space will be allocated to optimize office diversity by the Graduate Program Director prior to the beginning of the fall semester. Office diversity is defined as a mixture of research concentrations, graduate student year, nationality, sex, and gender. Requests to move within an office or between offices may be sent year-round to the Graduate Program Director, and solicited by the Director at the end of the academic year. Requests will be considered based on urgency.

### Appeals

A student may request a waiver from any of the DAES program policies by petitioning the Graduate Program Committee in writing. An exemption will be granted if a majority of committee members agree. If the Graduate Program Committee does not grant the request, the student may appeal to the DAES voting faculty, with a two-thirds vote required for the exemption to be granted.

### Conflict Resolution Guidelines

Issues between students and advisor(s) or between students should be brought to the attention of the Graduate Program Director, who is responsible for making a good faith effort to develop a resolution. If the issue persists or the resolution is not deemed satisfactory, all parities may speak with the Department Chair and then the CAS Dean’s office.

### Diversity and Inclusion

In order to foster an inclusive and equitable environment in DAES, the department has established a committee on Diversity and Inclusion (the IDC). Students may speak to any IDC member confidentially about any concern or issue related to the DAES workspace climate and/or their interactions with faculty, staff, or students. We encourage any behavior or instance that does not promote a respectful climate in DAES be brought to the attention of the IDC chair (Dr. Brian Tang) or any committee member. IDC members meet regularly with the UAlbany Office of Diversity and Inclusion and have been instructed on campus resources related to Title IX, counseling services, the Safe Space Program, and intercultural engagement, among others.

### ETEC Behavior

ETEC is a public space with numerous outside groups, government officials, and prospective students in the building on a regular basis. DAES students are expected to be respectful of ETEC visitors and to be mindful of discussing topics or using language that violate the University’s [Code of Student Conduct](https://www.albany.edu/dean-students/community-standards). In addition, ETEC has numerous, unique community spaces, including the Collaboratorium, where everyone should feel welcome to study, conduct office hours, perform group work, eat lunch, etc.. In each of these spaces, please practice self-awareness, respect personal privacy, and be aware of the volume of conversations.

If repeated problematic behavior is reported, disciplinary actions will be taken, which may include involving the student’s advisor or referral to the Office of Community Standards for a violation of the University’s [Code of Student Conduct](https://www.albany.edu/dean-students/community-standards).

### Social Networking Statement

Students who use social networking sites and other forms of electronic communication should be mindful of how their communication may be perceived by fellow students, faculty, and colleagues. As such, students should make every effort to minimize visual or printed material that may be deemed otherwise inappropriate in a professional environment. To this end, students are encouraged to set all security settings to “private” and should avoid posting information/photos and using any language that could jeopardize their professional image. Statements on social media sites are easily taken out of context due to their short nature.
