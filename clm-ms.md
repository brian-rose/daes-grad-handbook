# Climate Science M.S.

See also the [Climate Science M.S. description in the Graduate Bulletin](https://www.albany.edu/graduate-bulletin/climate-science-ms.php).

## Overview

The aims of the program leading to the M.S. in Climate Science are to (1) provide broad rigorous training in the fundamental theories and practices of the field, (2) ensure an advanced level of fluency in climate data analysis, and (3) develop the student’s ability to carry out guided scholarly research and to communicate the results concisely and accurately to the scientific community and the general public. Students may choose between two tracks: Climate Dynamics or Climate Chemistry & Physics. Both tracks prepare the student for a robust career in the public or private sector in areas such as climate data analysis and modeling, laboratory and field studies, environmental consulting, and education. The M.S. program also satisfies the track-specific course requirements for the Ph.D. in Climate Science, which is an appropriate pathway for students interested in advanced research and scientific leadership positions in academia, industry or government.

The M.S. in Climate Science requires two academic years of full-time study and research, or the equivalent over a longer period, beyond the baccalaureate. The program requires the completion of an original research-based Master’s thesis under advisement of one or more faculty members. Areas of research specialization within the two tracks include climate dynamics and modeling, polar environments, atmospheric chemistry, paleoclimate reconstruction, environmental geochemistry, physical oceanography and ocean-atmosphere interactions, remote sensing, urban climate, renewable energy, and applications of machine learning.

## Requirements for Admission

In addition to the general University at Albany requirements for admission to graduate study, an applicant's undergraduate preparation should include:

1. two semesters of a college calculus sequence for science/engineering majors;
2. one semester of college-level physics;
3. two semesters of college-level chemistry; and
4. basic skills in at least one computer coding language.

For the Climate Chemistry & Physics track, applicants must have one semester of college-level environmental science, geology, or geochemistry.

For the Climate Dynamics track, students must have one additional semester of a calculus sequence for science/engineering majors (3 semesters total) and the required physics course must be calculus-based.

These requirements would normally be met through a B.S. degree in Atmospheric Science/Meteorology, Oceanography, Geology, Environmental Science, Chemistry, Physics, or closely related field. A student who is deficient in these subjects will be expected to satisfy the deficiencies during the first year of graduate study, in consultation with their faculty advisor(s). A lack in one of more of these courses does not automatically disqualify a student from admission. Alternative courses, research, or work experience that demonstrate a strong background in math, physics, chemistry, and/or environmental science can provide equivalent preparation.

## Program Requirements

A minimum of 30 credits in graduate courses (500 level or above) is required for the Master’s (M.S.) degree, including:

1. 12 credits of core courses
2. Six credits of ATM 699 leading to an acceptable Master’s thesis
3. Supporting courses (0–12 credits): Additional courses, as advised
4. Satisfactory completion of the Major Field Examination (i.e., a 30-min presentation of research)
5. Ancillary Duties: In addition to the completion of course requirements, satisfactory performance in some ancillary teaching, research, or practicum duties contributing to academic development is required, whether or not the student receives financial support. These duties will be assigned with educational objectives in mind.
