# Atmospheric Science M.S.

See also the [Atmospheric Science M.S. description in the Graduate Bulletin](https://www.albany.edu/graduate-bulletin/atmospheric-science-ms.php).

## Atmospheric Science Requirements for Admission

In addition to the general University at Albany requirements for admission to graduate study, an applicant's undergraduate preparation should include: 
1. Three semesters of a college calculus sequence for science/engineering majors, with a course in differential equations;
2. two calculus-based, college physics courses or related physics and math-based engineering or natural sciences courses;
3. at least one college-level chemistry or geochemistry course. 

A student who is deficient in these subjects will be expected to make up the deficiencies during the first year of graduate study, in consultation with their faculty advisor(s). A lack in one or more of these courses does not automatically disqualify a student from admission. Alternative courses, research, or work experience that demonstrate a strong background in math and physics can provide equivalent preparation. With the increasing demand for data analysis skills in professional positions, incoming students are expected to have basic skills in at least one computer coding language.

## Atmospheric Science Program Requirements

1. A minimum of 30 credits in graduate courses (500 level or above) is required for the Master’s (M.S.) degree
2. Atmospheric science (18 credits, minimum):
    - Six credits of atmospheric physics: ATM 504 and any class with ATM 504 as a prerequisite 
    - Six credits of atmospheric dynamics: ATM 500 and any class with ATM 500 as a prerequisite
    - Six credits of ATM 699 leading to an acceptable Master’s thesis
3. Supporting courses (0–12 credits): Courses in other fields, as advised
4. Satisfactory completion of the Major Field Examination (i.e., a 30-min presentation of research)
5. Ancillary Duties: In addition to the completion of course requirements, satisfactory performance in some ancillary teaching, research, or practicum duties contributing to academic development is required, whether or not the student receives financial support. These duties will be assigned with educational objectives in mind.

Course descriptions can be found in the [Graduate Bulletin](https://www.albany.edu/graduate-bulletin/atmospheric-science-courses.php).


## M.S. Thesis and Presentation

Students should proceed with their M.S. thesis research in close collaboration with their advisor(s) following the requirements and timeline contained in the UAlbany Graduate Bulletin. The M.S. second reader will be available to the student for consultation. 

The M.S. thesis should demonstrate the candidate’s ability to successfully investigate a research problem, and their ability to arrive at results and conclusions that contribute to knowledge of the subject area. When the student and advisor(s) agree the M.S. thesis is in final form, a copy should be submitted to the second reader and a date for the M.S. thesis presentation scheduled (referred to as the “Major Field Examination” in the Graduate Bulletin). The M.S. thesis second reader must be given the completed thesis two weeks before the scheduled presentation or the [Graduate School’s deadline for submission](policies.md#thesis-due-dates), whichever comes first. The student will present their thesis by giving a 30-min seminar to the department, followed by questions and comments from the audience.
