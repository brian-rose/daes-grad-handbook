# Applied Atmospheric Science M.S.

See also [this section of the Graduate Bulletin](https://www.albany.edu/graduate-bulletin/applied-atmospheric-science-ms.php).

## Overview

The Applied Atmospheric Science Program is a 30-credit, non-thesis M.S. program that provides education and experiences in the application of atmospheric data and theory to problems related to the impact of weather, water, and climate on energy, agriculture, supply chain, as well as market and industry risk. The program includes options for formal courses in business, applied data analysis and programming, data visualization, and emergency management and communication, as well as professional experience through internships. 

## Requirements for Admission

In addition to the general University at Albany requirements for admission to graduate study, applicants must have a bachelor of science in Atmospheric Science/Meteorology/Climate Science or a bachelor of science in a related field with a minor and/or specialization/concentration in Atmospheric Science/Meteorology.

## Timeline

Designed to be a 1-year program, with 12 credits in the Fall and Spring semesters and 6 internship/applied research credits during the summer. The internship can also be completed during the academic year (i.e., 3 credits each semester), for 15 credits in the Fall and Spring semesters. Internships may be paid or unpaid; paid opportunities are prioritized, but we cannot guarantee that all internships will be paid.
